To build the iOS or Android apps, first create a file `cordova/build.json` with the appropriate [iOS](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/#using-buildjson) or [Android](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html#using-buildjson) settings.

Then run either:
```
yarn run ios
yarn run android
```
